## Definition:
-  A strongly typed language is a programming language that is more likely to generate errors if data does not closely match an expected type. Because JavaScript is loosely typed, you donâ€™t need to specify data types; however, this can lead to errors that are hard to diagnose due to implicit type coercion.

## Developer Console
- On Chrome to get into the JavaScript console, type cmd + option + i
- Console helps to write code and test it immediately to see its effect
